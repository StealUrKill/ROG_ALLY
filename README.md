 ROG ALLY HELPER
 
 This has just the silent mode CPU boost to disabled or agressive only. As of now it is embedded with PsExec due to the PowerSchemes registry set to SYSTEM and administrator do not have Full Control permissions. 
 You will need to select change registry to show the options in the power options under the advanced power settings. I will extract the resource on opening to temp and delete it on closing.
 
 I will add more to this if the testing seems to go well.
